In the first task, it is also possible to decompose the FlatList element and separate it from the App component. This approach would make the component more reusable and improve its readability.
The second task was completed without using any libraries, such as "axios", by utilizing the built-in JavaScript method fetch(). If necessary, axios can be implemented. A free API called jsonplaceholder was used in this task.
